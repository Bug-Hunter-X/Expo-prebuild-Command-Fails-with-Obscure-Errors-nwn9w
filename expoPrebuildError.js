This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command, particularly when dealing with complex project setups or custom native modules.  The core issue stems from misconfigurations or inconsistencies between your Expo project's setup and the underlying native Android or iOS build systems.  It might manifest as cryptic error messages within the native build logs that are difficult to directly trace back to specific code within your JavaScript project.
