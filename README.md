# Expo Prebuild Command Fails with Obscure Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive issue encountered when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command. The problem manifests as vague error messages during the native build process (Android/iOS), making debugging incredibly difficult because the root cause isn't directly apparent in the Expo project's JavaScript code.

## Problem Description

The `expo prebuild` command, crucial for integrating native modules or optimizing build processes, might fail without providing clear, actionable error messages.  This issue is more prevalent in projects with intricate structures or custom native modules. The resultant native build logs are often full of low-level errors, challenging to map back to specific JavaScript code.

## Solution

Detailed, step-by-step debugging strategies and potential solutions for resolving obscure errors during Expo's prebuild process. The suggested approaches cover areas such as:

1. **Thorough Log Analysis:**  Examining the complete native build logs for any patterns and clues. 
2. **Modular Debugging:** Isolating potential issues by incrementally building the project. 
3. **Dependency Verification:**  Checking the versions and compatibility of all native modules.
4. **Environment Consistency:** Ensuring consistency between development and build environments.
5. **Native Module Setup:**  Correctly implementing any custom native modules based on Expo's guidelines.

This repo helps developers understand how to effectively troubleshoot and solve these types of issues.
